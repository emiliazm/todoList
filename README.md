# Awesome books with ES6.

> Hello!
To do list is a single page website that allows you create a to do list. Re-creating this website you will learn how to give some functionality to your sections and make your website more user-interactive. Apart from creating and display a list you will learn how to set and get items from local storage and how to use ES6 and webpack.


## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Linters

### Prerequisites

Re-create your Awesome books app following the rules:
- Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed.
- Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty To Do List placeholder (<div> or <ul> element). The index.html file must be set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin.
- Create an index.js file and set an array of some simple to do tasks (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys:
description [string].
completed [bool].
index: [number].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should appear in order of the index values for each task.
- Create a style.css and set rules for the To Do List. CSS must be loaded by Webpack Style/CSS Loader. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
